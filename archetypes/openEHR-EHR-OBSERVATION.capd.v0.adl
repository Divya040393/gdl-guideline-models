			purpose = <"To screen for pediatric delirium. Hospitalized children, particularly those in the PICU, are at high risk of developing delirium. In turn, delirium in children is associated with complications such as increased length of stay, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and possible long-term neurodevelopmental issues.

			copyright = <"Cambio CDS">
			use = <"Use for critically ill pediatric patients aged 0-21 years. May be used in both developmentally normal and delayed patients.

Interpretation 
CAPD score >=9: Pediatric delirium present   
Recommendation: Investigate and treat underlying medical condition(s) causing delirium, consider interventions with parents and child life services, and/or consult to psychiatry or palliative care as appropriate, consider medications like melatonin or QUEtiapine (SEROquel) in select cases

CAPD score <9: Pediatric delirium present               
Recommendation: Continue usual care and monitoring
